# MatrixMultiplier

Welcome!

This is a personal project that I created during my Linear Algebra course at UMD. I decided to implement a matrix multiplier in C to utilize the power of dynamic memory
allocation and to further explore the capabilities of C. The multiplier contains validation to ensure the two provided matrices can be multiplied and then displays the
resulting matrix.

- There is no UI, input is done from the console
